/* 
ðŸŒŸ APP: Tip Calculator

These are the 3 functions you must use ðŸ‘‡
=========================================
calculateBill()
increasePeople()
decreasePeople()

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'billTotalInput' = User input for bill total
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'tipInput' = User input for tip
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'numberOfPeople' = Current number of people you're splitting the bill between
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'perPersonTotal' = Total dollar value owed per person
*/

// Get global access to all inputs / divs here (you'll need them later ðŸ˜˜)
// bill input, tip input, number of people div, and per person total div

numberOfPeople = document.getElementById('numberOfPeople')

  // get bill from user input & convert it into a number
  let totalBill = Number(billTotalInput.value)

  // get the tip from user & convert it into a percentage (divide by 100)
  let tip = Number(tipInput.value)
  let tipPercentage = tip / 100

  // get the total tip amount
  let tipAmount = totalBill * tipPercentage

  // calculate the total (tip amount + bill)
  let total = totalBill + tipAmount

  // calculate the per person total (total divided by number of people)
  let totalPerPerson = total / people

  // update the perPersonTotal on DOM & show it to user
  perPersonTotal.innerText = `$${totalPerPerson.toFixed(2)}`

}

// ** Splits the bill between more people **
const increasePeople = () => {
  // increment the amount of people
  people += 1

  // update the DOM with the new number of people
  numberOfPeople.innerText = `${people}`

  // calculate the bill based on the new number of people

}

// ** Splits the bill between fewer people **
const decreasePeople = () => {
  // guard clause
  // if amount is 1 or less simply return
  // (a.k.a you can't decrease the number of people to 0 or negative!)

  people -= 1

  // update the DOM with the new number of people
